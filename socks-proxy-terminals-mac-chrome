# Start a SOCKS proxy for Chrome and connect to cluster web UIs.

# In a new terminal on your laptop, create a SOCKS proxy:
sudo ssh -i /locationof/foo.pem -p 443 -D 80 -g user@pub-ip
# when prompted for a password, enter your laptop login password (prompted, because you are using sudo)
# Leave this terminal process active.

# In another terminal on your laptop, launch a Chrome instance that will use the proxy:
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \ --user-data-dir="$HOME/chrome-with-proxy" \ --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:80"
# Leave this terminal process active.
# This will open a new Chrome session. 

# Access the cluster web UIs directly 
Load http://PRIVATE-ip:webuiPortNum/ in the proxied browser tab and login.

# You will similarly be able to load other web UIs, in the same proxied session 
# (in the same Chrome tab or in additional tabs spawned from the original proxied Chrome tab)

# Troubleshooting
# If you have old stale connections, you will need to kill proxy in the first terminal window and restart it. 
# This typically becomes necessary if you changed networks you are connecting from or if the public IP 
# has changed. If Ctrl-C, then starting it again (pointing to the latest public ip) does not work, use these steps to troubleshoot
ps -ef | grep pem
kill -9 <pid>

# Using X11 to view Remote UI components without any HTML5 or VNC or RDP Desktop
# The xQuartz.app application on mac provides X11 capability, so launch that and run 
# the commands below in xQuartz terminal at the bash prompt to launch gedit or Firefox locally:

Bash 3.2$ ssh -CX -i ~/Documents/aws/pem/id_rsa user@host /usr/bin/gedit

Bash 3.2$ ssh -CX -i ~/Documents/aws/pem/id_rsa user@host /usr/bin/firefox

NOTE: On a Windows machine, install Cygwin to get X11 capability
NOTE: Still need to have the sudo ssh -i ~/id_rsa -p 443 -D 80 -g user@ipaddress port mapping working for the above commands to work.
