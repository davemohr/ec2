# Building the files you need to get the cert
# Tool to create a new CSR 
https://www.digicert.com/easy-csr/openssl.htm
# Fill in cert details, common name can be wildcard (e.g., *.domain.name.com)
# Key size RSA2048
# click Generate

# Create a directory on the instance called /home/centos/certs/<newcert> and cd to it.
# Run the commands below on a centos instance (on any centos machine with openssl installed)
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 \
-nodes -out star_foo.csr -keyout star_foo.key \
-subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=City/O=Company/OU=Dept/CN=*.foo-domain"

# The result is two files: a .csr, and a .key. 
# You paste the .csr into the https://www.digicert.com/secure/requests/ssl_certificate/ssl_wildcard page. 
# The page then shows the details contained in the csr. confirm that they look correct.

# After purchase
# Download the certificate as a .crt file to your laptop which will give you a zip file
# Scp the .zip file to the machine that contains the cert. 
# unzip
# It contains the .crt you need. You will also need the .key files you created before the purchase. 

# Run this type of command to convert the .crt to .pem (which is what Hue needs)
# adjust the parts of the command that are in red below to match your new files:

# Also, copy the .key file so that the copy has the .pem extension. Example:
cp star_foo.key star_foo-key.pem
