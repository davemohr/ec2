# If running ntpd
ntpdc -c iostat 
# Verifies packets are sent / received between the different peers. 
ntpq -c as
# Profiles information about the conditions of each peer. 
# The output of this command includes the association ID that can be used in combination with 'ntpq -c "rv "'
# to get more information about the status of each peer. 
ntpq -c pe
# Returns a summary of all peers and the reason they are not in use 

# If running chronyd
chronyc activity
# to check how many NTP sources are online/offline. 
chronyc sourcestats
# Provides more information about the conditions of each peer. To check chrony tracking, issue the command 'chronyc tracking'.
